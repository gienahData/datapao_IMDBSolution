Hi there!

Thank you for inviting me to complete the homework test. 

Please run the solution as follows: 

1. Please find enclosed the scraper code in php. 
2. The script is uploaded to my webpage. Please run the code from here https://www.geoinsight.hu/datapao/tunde250.php
It may take cc. 10 minutes because of retention that has been incorporated to avoid IMDB disabling the query. 
3. Results are extracted as top250.csv
4. Results were processed in Jupyter Notebook (anaconda3). Scripts are attached as a notebook ('BigIMDB_tunde.py') and markdown ('BigIMDB_tunde.md') file.
5. Final ranking was extracted as tunde20.csv

I am looking forward to hearing your remarks on my solution. 

Regards, 
TÃ¼nde
